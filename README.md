Automate your release process by creating release branches, updating version numbers, and generating changelogs based on PR data.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Branch Creation**: Create release branches from your development branch to your production branch
- **Version Management**: Automatically updates version information in your project
- **Changelog Generation**: Create detailed changelogs based on merged pull requests
- **Customizable Filtering**: Filter PRs by date ranges, specific IDs, or exclude patterns
- **GitHub Integration**: Creates and links pull requests for your releases

## üìã Prerequisites

This action requires:

1. A repository with at least two branches (source and target)
2. A `version.json` file in the root directory with a `version` field
3. `jq` installed on the runner (available by default on GitHub-hosted runners)
